<h1><span class="sp1">PYTHIAS</span></h1>

<h2>By FREDERIK POHL</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">I am</span> sitting on the edge of
what passes for a bed. It is
made of loosely woven strips
of steel, and there is no mattress,
only an extra blanket of thin
olive-drab. It isn't comfortable;
but of course they expect to make
me still more uncomfortable.</p>

<p>They expect to take me out of
this precinct jail to the District
prison and eventually to the
death house.</p>

<p>Sure, there will be a trial first,
but that is only a formality. Not
only did they catch me with the
smoking gun in my hand and
Connaught bubbling to death
through the hole in his throat,
but I admitted it.</p>

<p>I—knowing what I was doing,
with, as they say, malice aforethought—deliberately
shot to
death Laurence Connaught.</p>

<p>They execute murderers. So
they mean to execute me.</p>

<p>Especially because Laurence
Connaught had saved my life.</p>

<p>Well, there are extenuating circumstances.
I do not think they
would convince a jury.</p>

<p>Connaught and I were close
friends for years. We lost touch
during the war. We met again
in Washington, a few years after
the war was over. We had, to
some extent, grown apart; he had
become a man with a mission. He
was working very hard on something
and he did not choose to
discuss his work and there was
nothing else in his life on which
to form a basis for communication.
And—well, I had my own
life, too. It wasn't scientific research
in my case—I flunked out
of med school, while he went on.
I'm not ashamed of it; it is nothing
to be ashamed of. I simply
was not able to cope with the
messy business of carving corpses.
I didn't like it, I didn't want to
do it, and when I was forced to
do it, I did it badly. So—I left.</p>

<p>Thus I have no string of degrees,
but you don't need them
in order to be a Senate guard.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Does</span> that sound like a terribly
impressive career to you?
Of course not; but I liked it. The
Senators are relaxed and friendly
when the guards are around, and
you learn wonderful things about
what goes on behind the scenes
of government. And a Senate
guard is in a position to do favors—for
newspapermen, who find
a lead to a story useful; for government
officials, who sometimes
base a whole campaign on one
careless, repeated remark; and
for just about anyone who would
like to be in the visitors' gallery
during a hot debate.</p>

<p>Larry Connaught, for instance.
I ran into him on the street one
day, and we chatted for a moment,
and he asked if it was possible
to get him in to see the
upcoming foreign relations debate.
It was; I called him the
next day and told him I had
arranged for a pass. And he was
there, watching eagerly with his
moist little eyes, when the Secretary
got up to speak and there
was that sudden unexpected yell,
and the handful of Central
American fanatics dragged out
their weapons and began trying
to change American policy with
gunpowder.</p>

<p>You remember the story, I
suppose. There were only three
of them, two with guns, one with
a hand grenade. The pistol men
managed to wound two Senators
and a guard. I was right there,
talking to Connaught. I spotted
the little fellow with the hand
grenade and tackled him. I
knocked him down, but the grenade
went flying, pin pulled,
seconds ticking away. I lunged
for it. Larry Connaught was
ahead of me.</p>

<p>The newspaper stories made
heroes out of both of us. They
said it was miraculous that
Larry, who had fallen right on
top of the grenade, had managed
to get it away from himself and
so placed that when it exploded
no one was hurt.</p>

<p>For it did go off—and the flying
steel touched nobody. The
papers mentioned that Larry had
been knocked unconscious by the
blast. He was unconscious, all
right.</p>

<p>He didn't come to for six
hours and when he woke up, he
spent the next whole day in a
stupor.</p>

<p>I called on him the next night.
He was glad to see me.</p>

<p>"That was a close one, Dick,"
he said. "Take me back to
Tarawa."</p>

<p>I said, "I guess you saved my
life, Larry."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Dick! I just
jumped. Lucky, that's all."</p>

<p>"The papers said you were
terrific. They said you moved so
fast, nobody could see exactly
what happened."</p>

<p>He made a deprecating gesture,
but his wet little eyes were
wary. "Nobody was really watching,
I suppose."</p>

<p>"I was watching," I told him
flatly.</p>

<p>He looked at me silently for a
moment.</p>

<p>"I was between you and the
grenade," I said. "You didn't go
past me, over me, or through me.
But you were on top of the
grenade."</p>

<p>He started to shake his head.</p>

<p>I said, "Also, Larry, you fell
<i>on</i> the grenade. It exploded
underneath you. I know, because
I was almost on top of you, and
it blew you clear off the floor of
the gallery. Did you have a
bulletproof vest on?"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He</span> cleared his throat. "Well,
as a matter of—"</p>

<p>"Cut it out, Larry! What's the
answer?"</p>

<p>He took off his glasses and
rubbed his watery eyes. He
grumbled, "Don't you read the
papers? It went off a yard away."</p>

<p>"Larry," I said gently, "I was
there."</p>

<p>He slumped back in his chair,
staring at me. Larry Connaught
was a small man, but he never
looked smaller than he did in that
big chair, looking at me as
though I were Mr. Nemesis himself.</p>

<p>Then he laughed. He surprised
me; he sounded almost happy.
He said, "Well, hell, Dick—I had
to tell somebody about it sooner
or later. Why not you?"</p>

<p>I can't tell you all of what he
said. I'll tell most of it—but not
the part that matters.</p>

<p>I'll never tell <i>that</i> part to <i>anybody</i>.</p>

<p>Larry said, "I should have
known you'd remember." He
smiled at me ruefully, affectionately.
"Those bull sessions in the
cafeterias, eh? Talking all night
about everything. But you remembered."</p>

<p>"You claimed that the human
mind possessed powers of psychokinesis,"
I said. "You argued
that just by the mind, without
moving a finger or using a machine,
a man could move his
body anywhere, instantly. You
said that nothing was impossible
to the mind."</p>

<p>I felt like an absolute fool
saying those things; they were
ridiculous notions. Imagine a
man <i>thinking</i> himself from one
place to another! But—I had been
on that gallery.</p>

<p>I licked my lips and looked to
Larry Connaught for confirmation.</p>

<p>"I was all wet," Larry laughed.
"Imagine!"</p>

<p>I suppose I showed surprise,
because he patted my shoulder.</p>

<p>He said, becoming sober,
"Sure, Dick, you're wrong, but
you're right all the same. The
mind alone can't do anything of
the sort—that was just a silly
kid notion. But," he went on,
"<i>but</i> there are—well, techniques—linking
the mind to physical
forces—simple physical forces
that we all use every day—that
can do it all. Everything! Everything
I ever thought of and
things I haven't found out yet.</p>

<p>"Fly across the ocean? In a
second, Dick! Wall off an exploding
bomb? Easily! You saw
me do it. Oh, it's work. It takes
energy—you can't escape natural
law. That was what knocked me
out for a whole day. But that was
a hard one; it's a lot easier, for
instance, to make a bullet miss its
target. It's even easier to lift
the cartridge out of the chamber
and put it in my pocket, so that
the bullet can't even be fired.
Want the Crown Jewels of England?
I could get them, Dick!"</p>

<p>I asked, "Can you see the future?"</p>

<p>He frowned. "That's silly. This
isn't supersti—"</p>

<p>"How about reading minds?"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Larry's</span> expression cleared.
"Oh, you're remembering
some of the things I said years
ago. No, I can't do that either,
Dick. Maybe, some day, if I keep
working at this thing— Well, I
can't right now. There are things
I can do, though, that are just
as good."</p>

<p>"Show me something you can
do," I asked.</p>

<p>He smiled. Larry was enjoying
himself; I didn't begrudge it to
him. He had hugged this to himself
for years, from the day he
found his first clue, through the
decade of proving and experimenting,
almost always being
wrong, but always getting closer....
He <i>needed</i> to talk about it.
I think he was really glad that,
at last, someone had found him
out.</p>

<p>He said, "Show you something?
Why, let's see, Dick." He
looked around the room, then
winked. "See that window?"</p>

<div class="figr"><img src="images/001.png" width="351" height="500" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>I looked. It opened with a
slither of wood and a rumble of
sash weights. It closed again.</p>

<p>"The radio," said Larry. There
was a <i>click</i> and his little set
turned itself on. "Watch it."</p>

<p>It disappeared and reappeared.</p>

<p>"It was on top of Mount Everest,"
Larry said, panting a little.</p>

<p>The plug on the radio's electric
cord picked itself up and
stretched toward the baseboard
socket, then dropped to the floor
again.</p>

<p>"No," said Larry, and his voice
was trembling, "I'll show you a
hard one. Watch the radio, Dick.
I'll run it without plugging it in!
The electrons themselves—"</p>

<p>He was staring intently at the
little set. I saw the dial light go
on, flicker, and hold steady; the
speaker began to make scratching
noises. I stood up, right behind
Larry, right over him.</p>

<p>I used the telephone on the
table beside him. I caught him
right beside the ear and he folded
over without a murmur.
Methodically, I hit him twice
more, and then I was sure he
wouldn't wake up for at least an
hour. I rolled him over and put
the telephone back in its cradle.</p>

<p>I ransacked his apartment. I
found it in his desk: All his notes.
All the information. The secret of
how to do the things he could do.</p>

<p>I picked up the telephone and
called the Washington police.
When I heard the siren outside, I
took out my service revolver and
shot him in the throat. He was
dead before they came in.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">For</span>, you see, I knew Laurence
Connaught. We were friends.
I would have trusted him with
my life. But this was more than
just a life.</p>

<p>Twenty-three words told how
to do the things that Laurence
Connaught did. Anyone who
could read could do them. Criminals,
traitors, lunatics—the
formula would work for anyone.</p>

<p>Laurence Connaught was an
honest man and an idealist, I
think. But what would happen to
any man when he became God?
Suppose you were told twenty-three
words that would let you
reach into any bank vault, peer
inside any closed room, walk
through any wall? Suppose pistols
could not kill you?</p>

<p>They say power corrupts; and
absolute power corrupts absolutely.
And there can be no more
absolute power than the twenty-three
words that can free a man
of any jail or give him anything
he wants. Larry was my friend.
But I killed him in cold blood,
knowing what I did, because he
could not be trusted with the
secret that could make him king
of the world.</p>

<p>But I can.</p>
